# Overview

This project is an exploration into the capabilities of JavaScript and Three.js, focusing on creating interactive 3D graphics. By developing a scene with bouncing 3D objects, I aimed to deepen my understanding of 3D rendering and animation principles in web development. This endeavor is part of my ongoing journey as a software engineer to expand my skill set and grasp complex programming concepts.

In this project, I've developed a simple yet visually engaging web application where users can observe three distinct 3D objects (a cube, a sphere, and a cone) bouncing in a synchronized manner. The primary purpose of this software is to explore and demonstrate the use of JavaScript, specifically with the Three.js library, in creating and animating 3D objects in a web environment.

Watch the software demo video for a detailed run-through of the application in action and a code walkthrough, where I share insights about JavaScript language syntax and Three.js functionalities.

# Development Environment

The project was developed using the following tools and technologies:
- Visual Studio Code: As the primary code editor for writing JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.
- Three.js: A JavaScript 3D library that makes WebGL simpler, used for creating and displaying animated 3D computer graphics in a web browser.
- Git and GitHub: For version control and source code management.

The main programming language used in this project is JavaScript, alongside HTML and CSS for structuring and styling the webpage. Three.js library played a crucial role in rendering 3D graphics and animations.

# Useful Websites

Here are some websites that were instrumental in the completion of this project:

- [Three.js Documentation](https://threejs.org/docs/index.html)
- [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/)

# Future Work

Several enhancements and additions are planned for future iterations of this project:

- Improving the responsiveness of the 3D scene for different screen sizes.
- Integrating user interaction elements to control the movement of the 3D objects.
- Enhancing the visual appeal by adding advanced lighting and textures.
